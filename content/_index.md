# **Overview of OpenShift**

OpenShift is a comprehensive enterprise-grade container orchestration platform that enables organizations to build, deploy, and manage containerized applications efficiently. It is based on Kubernetes and provides additional features to simplify and enhance the deployment process, making it suitable for production-grade environments.

OpenShift is a layer of Red Hat components that sit on top of a Kubernetes cluster  Using OpenShift makes it easier to install, configure, network, and manage applications composed of containers.

## **Key Components**

1. **OpenShift Container Platform (OCP)**  
   - The flagship product that provides a Kubernetes-based platform with enterprise-grade features.  
   - Includes Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) as the default operating system for the control plane and worker nodes.

2. **Kubernetes**  
   - OpenShift is built on Kubernetes and extends its capabilities with additional tools and features.

3. **Source-to-Image (S2I)**  
   - A unique feature of OpenShift that allows developers to build container images directly from source code.

4. **Operator Framework**  
   - Facilitates managing applications as Operators, automating tasks like installation, scaling, and upgrades.

5. **OpenShift Pipelines**  
   - A CI/CD solution based on Tekton for creating and managing containerized build and deployment pipelines.

6. **Service Mesh**  
   - Built on Istio, OpenShift Service Mesh provides traffic management, security, and observability for microservices.

7. **OpenShift Virtualization**  
   - Integrates virtual machines (VMs) with containers for hybrid workloads.

8. **Red Hat Quay**  
   - A container registry for managing and storing container images securely.

9. **Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM)**  
   - Manages multiple OpenShift clusters across hybrid and multi-cloud environments.
